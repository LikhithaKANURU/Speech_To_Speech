# Speech_To_Speech
: This project uses cloud APIs to convert spoken language to text, translate it, and convert it back to speech in the target language. Ideal for real-time communication across languages, it leverages services like Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or IBM Watson for seamless translation and speech synthesis.
